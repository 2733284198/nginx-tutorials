This repository holds the source scripts for my Nginx tutorial series
published here: http://blog.sina.com.cn/openresty

1. install perl 5.8.1+ into your system (usually it is already
   installed on *NIX systems.

2. install the Perl CPAN module List::MoreUtils with the
   command:

        sudo cpan List::MoreUtils

3. Install Calibre from here: http://calibre-ebook.com/

4. Build the ebook files *.mobi and *.epub

        make

   Note that Gnu make is also required. On most *BSD systems,
   it's usually required to run "gmake" instead of "make" here.
